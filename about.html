                <p>
                    Anja Ringgren Lovén grew up in Frederikshavn,
                    Denmark where she was a store manager until 2011. 
                    After a trip to Africa where she saw extreme 
                    poverty and the heartbreaking fate of witch 
                    children, her traditional and safe life in Denmark stopped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anja made a choice. She wanted to dedicate her life 
                    and work to combat the conditions that children in 
                    Africa live under. She chose to fight, and still 
                    fights, for a cause that takes up almost all the 
                    room in her heart, which is why she has taken such a nontraditional
                        path in life - something she never regretted.

                The Danish Anja Ringgren Lovén is
                 the founder of the non-profit 
                 organization DINNødhjælp.
            </p>
            <p>
                DINNødhjælp allows Anja and her team to take
                are of the exposed witch children in Africa.
                Witch children is the term used for children 
                who have been accused of witchcraft by the superstition
                prevailing in Africa as a result of very low or no education.
                The citizens and priests label the children as witches if,
                for example, the family experiences death, illness, crop
                failure, dismissals or infertility. The child gets the blame
                and is then punished accordingly - tortured or, at worst,
                sentenced to death.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through DINNødhjælp, Anja has created
                a home for the children who were strongly missing
                a sense of security. Here they get care, a roof
                over their heads, food and education.
